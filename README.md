# DesignPatternsInCSharp
Date: Feb/2023
## **Disclaimer**
This is the record of a personal study session, where I intended to find a way to implement the design patterns listed on the **well-known book from the GoF**, and uncover any constraints they would eventually have when implemented in .Net.
These implementations:
- are straight-forward and focused on the overall idea of the pattern, so I disregarded some coding best practices on purpose;
- are not intended to be "decisive" nor "the best way" of implementing those patterns, as their implementation on a real-world application would certainly have many other requirements to be taken into consideration.
